## Description

Here I've created a mock web application for my Dad's farming business. It demonstrates what a basic marketplace for such a business would look like and how it would behave. At some point I would like to add functionality that would get it off the ground however the business isn't quite ready for full production.

## Description of the build 

Additionally, I built this app as practice for a full MERN stack application and it demonstrates some of the capabilities of such an app.
