                Our mission is to grow and support local small business farms. We have a 
                unique eco-system that includes free range birds, livestock protection, lots of wonderful herbacious foods.
                Our birds provide fertilizer for our gardens and orchard whilst living off the pastures full of nutritious
                greens and insects around the property. Our lifestock protection includes Great Pyrenees that keep away predators
                and of course barn cats for the varmints. We grow many delicious seasonal fruits and vegtables to keep you happy and healthy. 
                Our goal is to provide enough surplus to support our communnities with delicious home grown food!
